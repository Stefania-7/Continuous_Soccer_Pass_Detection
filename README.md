# Continuous_Soccer_Pass_Detection

This work champions the application of SML approaches to the ACM DEBS 2013 Grand Challenge data source. Specifically, data collected from sensors in players’ shoes and the ball during a soccer match is used to create balanced and imbalanced datasets, focusing on pass classification based exclusively on leg movement. The main contributions of the project include:
• Presenting a performance comparison between traditional Machine Learning and SML classification algorithms using a balanced dataset to classify soccer passes by analyzing only the leg movement and demonstrating that the results achieved are comparable.
• Evaluating the generalization abilities of the algorithms with imbalanced test sets to investigate if the performance remains unchanged.
• Showing that SML outperforms traditional ML in the same performance comparison using larger rebalanced datasets generated synthetically through static and dynamic methods.
• Confirming the performance results within the rebalanced datasets using statistical tests.
